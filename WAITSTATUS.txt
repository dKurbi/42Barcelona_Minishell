WIFEXITED and WEXITSTATUS are two of the options which can be used to know the exit status of the child. 


WIFEXITED(status) : returns true if the child terminated normally. (si ha salido bien)


WEXITSTATUS(status) : returns the exit status of the child. This macro should be employed only if WIFEXITED returned true.
Below is a C implementation in which child uses execl() function but the path specified to execl() is undefined.
(WEXITSTATUS siempre tenemos que poner si WIFEXITED salido con true)
